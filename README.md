# Progress Bar Project

This is a simple project demonstrating an interactive progress bar using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Description

This project includes a progress bar that advances one step at a time when the "Next" button is clicked and retracts when the "Prev" button is clicked.

## Implementation

We are using vanilla JavaScript to add interactivity to the progress bar.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the project, including the progress bar and the "Next" and "Prev" buttons.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styles used in the project. The progress bar and buttons are styled here.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the project. It includes event listeners for the "Next" and "Prev" buttons and a function (`moveProgressLine`) to handle these events.

## Running the Project

To view the project, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. 

## Future Enhancements

While this project serves as a basic demonstration of a progress bar, there's plenty of room for improvements and additional features, such as:

- Adding a completion message when the progress bar reaches the end.
- Resetting the progress bar after completion.
- Including transition animations for smoother movement between steps.
- Allowing for a dynamic number of steps, rather than a fixed amount.
